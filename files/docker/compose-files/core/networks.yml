# There is no need to create any networks outside this docker-compose file.
# You may customize the network subnets (192.168.90.0/24 and 91.0/24) below as you please.
# Docker Compose version 3.5 or higher required to define networks this way.

    driver: bridge
  traefik_proxy:
    name: traefik_proxy

    # To setup a subnet and allow certain containers to gain a static ip in it
    # Useful for connecting containers that won't have open ports running behind traefik so you can specify the static IP of the container
