# Let's allow the user to edit ansible vaults in-place instead of flat out decrypting it to reduce risk of pushing it in cleartext to remote repo.
# Even though I've got the git commit hook in place, when the repo name changes for example, and repo is cloned fresh, this poses a problem when forgetting to run `make setup` first and deploying the hook.
# This approach is just far safer than decrypting and encrypting the files themselves below.
